In one of the remote streets of Moscow, in a gray house with white columns, a mezzanine and a crooked balcony, there once lived a lady, a widow, surrounded by numerous servants. Her sons served in St. Petersburg, her daughters got married; She rarely went out and lived out the last years of her stingy and bored old age in solitude. Her day, joyless and stormy, has long passed; but her evening was blacker than night.

Of all her servants, the most remarkable person was the janitor Gerasim, a man twelve inches tall, built like a hero and deaf-mute from birth. The lady took him from the village, where he lived alone, in a small hut, separately from his brothers, and was considered perhaps the most serviceable draft man.
